Dear Mr. Kreuger,

I have been a loyal customer for over 15 years.  I have had many memorable times coming to your farm to pick fruits, pumpkins and feast on the goodies sold in your market. I expected the same experience today, but sadly, was greatly mistaken. 

I came to pick raspberries, but because it was raining, was in the market area waiting for the rain to subside. While I was contemplating buying a flat, one of your employees brought over a sign that raised the price of the flats and stuck it on the cart. When I remarked about the price, she flippantly said that I was too slow and should have gotten it sooner.

I saw you come over and was about to make a comment, when you interrupted me and said, ""that's what supply and demand is."" And walked away.

I would like to believe that you and your staff were just having a bad day and that customers usually are usually treated with better customer service instead of being subjected to the blatant price hikes and rude comments I experienced today.

Your ""lesson"" in supply and demand was taken to heart. And I'm sorry to say that I will never be coming back to support your market again. Also, I will encourage my friends and colleagues who are looking for farm fresh produce and fruits to consider alternative more customer friendly establishments. 

I know my change in patronage will not impact your bottom line at all, but I would encourage you to think about what true customer service means and practice that with your other patrons, before the demand for your goods drops due to how you treat your customers.

Sincerely,
Former Kreuger farms fan",2013-06-24 07:14:55,07:14:55,6.0,2013.0,289.0,1651.0,4.562711864406779,129.0,open letter kreuger farm dear mr kreuger loyal customer 15 year many memorable time coming farm pick fruit pumpkin feast goody sold market expected experience today sadly greatly mistaken came pick raspberry raining market area waiting rain subside contemplating buying flat one employee brought sign raised price flat stuck cart remarked price flippantly said slow gotten sooner saw come make comment interrupted said thats supply demand walked away would like believe staff bad day customer usually usually treated better customer service instead subjected blatant price hike rude comment experienced today lesson supply demand taken heart im sorry say never coming back support market also encourage friend colleague looking farm fresh produce fruit consider alternative customer friendly establishment know change patronage impact bottom line would encourage think true customer service mean practice patron demand good drop due treat customer sincerely former kreuger farm fan,0.09683333333333334,0.5305000000000001,0.08,0.764,0.157,0.9852,negative,0.0,"order, time, wait, food, table, give, ask, back, service, never","['open', 'letter', 'farm', 'dear', 'loyal', 'customer', 'year', 'memorable', 'time', 'farm', 'pick', 'fruit', 'pumpkin', 'feast', 'goody', 'sell', 'market', 'expect', 'experience', 'today', 'sadly', 'greatly', 'mistaken', 'pick', 'raspberry', 'rain', 'market', 'area', 'wait', 'rain', 'subside', 'contemplate', 'buy', 'flat', 'employee', 'bring', 'sign', 'raise', 'price', 'flat', 'stick', 'remark', 'price', 'flippantly', 'slow', 'sooner', 'comment', 'interrupt', 'supply', 'demand', 'walk', 'away', 'believe', 'staff', 'bad', 'day', 'customer', 'usually', 'usually', 'treat', 'well', 'customer', 'service', 'instead', 'blatant', 'price', 'hike', 'rude', 'comment', 'experience', 'today', 'lesson', 'supply', 'demand', 'heart', 'sorry', 'never', 'back', 'support', 'market', 'encourage', 'friend', 'colleague', 'look', 'farm', 'fresh', 'produce', 'fruit', 'consider', 'alternative', 'customer', 'friendly', 'establishment', 'change', 'patronage', 'impact', 'bottom', 'encourage', 'true', 'customer', 'service', 'mean', 'practice', 'patron', 'demand', 'drop', 'due', 'treat', 'customer', 'sincerely', 'former', 'fan']"

Plenty of quality Pork, Beef, and Chicken product proudly displayed their chilled cases.
A little bit of Salmon, various sausages, deli meats, and treats were also offered.
A steady flow of customers were handled in a professional and friendly manner.
We opted for: Pork Spareribs, some headcheese (just for giggles), two kinds of jerky, ham, and bacon. 
The result was a great rib dinner with fixins and money left in the old wallet.

So much so that I did not finish my meal. My husband had ordered the chicken sandwich and I ordered the hot chicken plate. He also ordered the fries with no pickle. After we had sat down they brought my husband the fries and said he could have them on the house because they accidentally put pickle but they would be bringing out a new order without the pickle. In my opinion that was a very good move however the new backs they brought out had a hair in it and we ended up not eating it nor did we bother to bring it to the front. Why? Because by this time we had also received our main meals and those were so unsatisfactory is that we had some get up as not a good food place so no point to ask for new ones. My chicken plate was nothing but mush. The chicken was so thin or had been pounded so much that it had tears in the middle so really it was only a mangled piece of chicken covered in so much breading and sauce that it tasted like mushy meat when eating it. My husband's chicken sandwich suffered the same but also lacked an incredible amount of flavor. It was so Bland!

I expected so much more from this place because of the reviews, however when we were there we could tell a lot of people had ordered the tofu sandwich.

Surprisingly the steak isn't bad, either.  You can get grilled sirloin every night, cooked to order.  Clearly the meat is injected for tenderness and flavor, but it always comes out hot and fresh with consistent texture.  I've had worse tasting and tougher at expensive steak places. 

Another surprising item is the freshly sauteed green beans which are available only some of the time, with sauteed onions and whole strips of bacon. When those are gone, the cooks open a can of regular green beans that are unseasoned and boiled.  Not so good.

The atmosphere is what you'd expect for a food trough, compete with human visual appetite suppressants waddling around you.  It's enough for me to ratchet down the quantities I consume while still enjoying a few of the more quality items.

Dinner is $10.99 and it's worth adding a drink for $2.  Drink choices now include a guilty assortment of Icees with my favorite, cherry pomegranate.  It's surprisingly good for a childhood dessert beverage.

We were greeted with a sample cup to taste all those wonderful flavors of frozen yogurt. There are so many flavors to choose. My favorite is Chocolate Cake a la Mode.

As we were ordering our pie and a grilled turkey sandwich, a short blond waitress asked if we were dinning in or taking out because, ""we are closing in 30 minutes!"". We said dinning in please and added with a smile we will be fast. The rude part is she wasn't even the person taking our order a gentleman was. She came up from the side and interrupted mid order to inform us about closing in 30 minutes. We all felt uncomfortable and unwelcome. We even thought about leaving.  We got our pie and had to wait until 9:50 for our sandwich. Before we even got our sandwich the woman got on the loud speaker to announce of the closing... we thought what about our sandwich?  The sandwich was announced ready, a minute later. We were so worried about being done in 9 minutes we couldn't even enjoy our meal or experience. We wrapped our sandwich in a napkin and discarded our pie to get out in time.

The food is fairly good.  I took my wife here recently for her birthday.  I had salmon, one of their 5 version of it, in truffle sauce.  it came out almost like a fajita.  The onions and mushrooms had the nice fajita consitancy, and the salom, a fairly average piece of it, was placed on top.  The salmon alone was meh at best, but the mushroom sauce and the grilled onions and mushrooms definitely made the meal.  My wife got some opakapaka (which I later learned to some sort of Hawaiian snapper).  I tried a btie and it was one of the better wish fish preparations I have had.  I am a fan of red fish, but not too fond of white fish, however I would definitely eat it the way this was prepared.

Overall a good place for a date.

 new patio awesome! some of the decor is kinda strange, but nice improvement.  Unless you are really hot, sit in the lower part when the fans are going because they only have two options, strong or off.  When the fan is on, it cools the pita bread so fast it becomes chips. Which defeats the whole allure of having fresh, soft pita bread.  Which brings me to the most horrible change of them all, the dipping oil up-charge.  

When you first get the bread, everyone goes crazy and can't get enough pita and the dipping oil with the spices! oh man! and for me personally, it was the thing I loved most about coming here.  Now, after you have polished off your first table serving of dipping oil (there were 5 adults so, it went relatively fast), they bring out the next pita and we ask for more dipping oil, it's going to be $1.50! I understand an up-charge, but $1.50 for oil, dry spices, and sesame seeds?! and the waitress then said, ""so, if you want to pay for it..."" like she knew it was bullshit. Figure out a better way of telling the customer it's bullshit without making them feel like suckers for saying yes.  

A lot of menu items have been taken off the list, a lot of the lamb is gone except for one entree, which wasn't that good.  There is a lot of beef, few chicken and one, maybe two lamb options. I also think they re-worked the mezza plates.  The falafel was really good and I would get that if nothing else, oh and a date soda. It's about $15 ahead. I hate the new menu with all the blown up pictures behind the food items, it's distracting.

They are opening up a bar on the second level, probably to accommodate the new apartment complex that's going in right across the street. I understand updating a menu and accommodating increasing food prices, but I think they are being a little greedy. I think they are hoping their reputation will keep people coming back no matter what they do.

So much so I decided Linda and I should check it out.  Thanks to traffic in this wonderful town, she arrived late to see some friends of mine, so we decided instead to enjoy our time in town and ended up here.

Not in the mood for a full on dinner, plus the bankroll was a little thin, we hit the bar for appetizers and near privacy.  We sat at a little table by the window at the far (as in closest to the door) end of the bar.  For the longest time, read: most of the time, we were alone.  It was nice.  Very nice in fact.

We split the Queso Fundido and Ecuadorian Potato Cakes, not realizing there actually is a menu for those without the love of meat.  But it was near divine.  I'm a sucker for cheese.  Especially for cheese with peppers and other fine additions.  I wanted to take it home and slather it all over... I mean it was wonderful.  Linda loved it as well.  Washed it down with a beer and life was good.

Service was, well, spotty.  I think maybe because we were far away, or that our order was pretty plain, the waitress kind of ignored us.  Not in a ""you're not good enough way"" but in a ""you don't even register on my radar"" sort of way.

The polenta cake seemed out of place and did not really add to the dish other than a stomach filler.
For dessert, we tried the flourless chocolate cake with salted caramel ice cream. The ice cream was icy and had chunks of salt in it, which I did not like. The cake was dense, a bit on the dry side, and kind of like a flattened brownie--I would not order it again.

112,P3dk909qDuSmdXVDU2wC4w,OS0kKNR7NQY1AZEw4XYCdg,1.0,39.0,4.0,6.0,"We were very excited. We made it date night. We are both in the hospitality industry and were really rooting for this to be a great place. Our spidey senses went off almost immediately, though -- this was not going to be a great dining experience. 

Some of their failures are due to being new and can be fixed. The place was pretty empty, and the pointed choice by the owner (we asked) to not have any ambient music at all was disconcerting. Basically silence, punctuated by kitchen noise. I felt super sorry for the cooks, who apparently have to work in silence for their entire shifts, since otherwise that's all the guests would hear. Lose the attitude. Pipe in some sound, at least until business picks up.

The ambiance left a little to be desired. Nothing special about it, relatively  uncomfortable tables lined up along the walls, some standard-issue ""New England fishing scheme"" decor.

But we were there for the food, so we tucked in. Service was OK. I didn't love the fact that, although admittedly my date was more outgoing than I was, the waiter addressed all of his remarks/conversation/etc. exclusively to him (I'm female). And it didn't seem to be in a flirtatious way, more a completely-ignoring-that-I-existed way. A little weird. But, again: we're here for the food. So....

I love lobster, particularly lobster rolls, which any shitty bar in New England can do adequately for under $10 (or fantastically, if you're lucky). I'll certainly pay a premium since those little fellas have to be shipped across the country, but I did feel a little ridiculous eating $18 pub food. Nonetheless, we ordered a cup of each of the soups (Lobster Bisque and Salmon Chowder) to begin, and Lobster Newberg and a Lobster Roll entree to share.

The bisque was very decent. Good smoked paprika flavor, nice, well-cooked chunks of lobster - not rubbery and overdone at all, but fresh, juicy, and succulent. It wasn't fantastic, but gave us real hope for the lobster to follow. The salmon chowder was utterly forgettable - seriously, I've had more memorable from a food cart. Not bad - just not special, and up here in the northwest, you can get fantastic salmon chowder pretty much everywhere. The plating was problematic: we ordered cups, and were served large, full bowls. We could very well have been satisfied and left at that point, given the amount of soup. Not complaining, I suppose, but this isn't a good sign that they know what they're doing. It looked bad as a presentation, and it's wasteful on the food costs. (We didn't really have commentary on the much-debated rolls; they were fine.)

I love the Northwest, but dammit, vegetables do not need to be added to every single dish... the addition of what appeared to be succotash to the lobster newberg was... surprising... and not in a good way. Whole peapods, baby carrots, and a ton of corn made this more ""lobster pot pie"" than newberg. The sauce was gummy, and the puff pastry was stiff, overworked, and flavorless. The lobster itself was lovely - well-cooked and delicious. We picked it off of the dish and ate it alone.

As for my lobster roll, I know there are two traditions, one erring more towards just butter as a binder, the other to mayonnaise, but completely dry lobster is a fail in both camps. The bun was fine (butter toasted hot-dog style bread), the lobster was tasty and well-cooked, but the whole thing was very dry. (I craved a Cambridge-bar roll, or at least some aioli on the side to baste this one with.) Served with forgettable shoestring fries and a meh coleslaw. 

With the bisque being ""good,"" the salmon chowder being ""meh,"" the newberg being ""downright awful,"" and the roll being ""meh,"" nothing about the silent and sterile ambiance being comfortable and inclining us to spend more time there/return/be romantic/eat more/etc., and the prices being relatively high, there is absolutely no chance we would return or recommend this place, particularly when you could go to dozens of better comparably-priced restaurants and have a marvelous dinner, presented beautifully, in a welcoming atmosphere.

He didn't write any of our orders down and messed up on our drinks, forgot an appetizer (and when we asked about it, was dumbfounded and asked if we still wanted it????) and got one of the main courses wrong. And that was after he blamed the computer for malfunctioning and so he had to ask again to confirm our dinner orders. Twice I had to get up to ask for more water. And this is an empty restaurant!

Meanwhile, our biggest meal up to that point on that special first day in Portland was taking individual bites of four yeast-raised monstrosities at Voodoo Doughnuts, so it would be appropriate to describe Jamie W. and me as feeling peckish anticipating our upcoming green papaya salad. When we passed by this trendy yet spacious shop, we were naturally intrigued. There was a polar bear in a ski cap and ice cream pop art on the wall (photo: http://bit.ly/2ujpQ7l).

They had chocolate and vanilla, but of course, it had to be Valrhona Chocolate and Madagascar Vanilla. What was more intriguing to us were the two non-dairy froyo options that were apparently made from almond milk. Something sweet before dinner couldn't hurt, right? Jamie went for the Hazelnut Praline which for a small $3.95 cup, was a generously tall serving (photo: http://bit.ly/2KKa1BF). That meant I had to get a small cup of the Vanilla Latte which plopped over in pure exhaustion from the spigot (photo: http://bit.ly/2KVvBTc). Refreshing and not too sweet. It was the perfect unintended appetizer on such an eventful Portland day.

Last time, I missed out on the Kelaguen Mannok, and I made certain not to get shut out again. I basically did everything short of calling in to reserve a bowl. Spicy pandas gotta eat, you know.

Kelaguen Mannok is a cold dish with chopped grilled chicken, lemon, grated coconut, peppers, and onions. Some minced Bird's Eye chili also gets added to make it a tad spicier. I honestly don't know what took me so long to order this. OK, so there are 700 food carts in Portland. Can't find this elsewhere (at least to my knowledge).

With all due respect to the Bird's Eye chili, the lemon really makes this dish pop that much more. The refreshing aspect keeps me coming back for another bite. Slowly but surely, the heat will intensify, but it's not gonna make me race to the nearest water fountain.

Hineksa Agaga (red rice) is really white rice with achotte added to give it its color. It's characterized as having a slightly sweet, nutty, and peppery flavor. Achotte is basically used like saffron to flavor and color rice.

Make sure you ask for the Finadene, because that stuff is awesome. Soy sauce, lemon, chili peppers, onions. The heart of Chamorro cuisine. Add it to your rice and Kelaguen Mannok, then thank me after you've recovered from your food coma.

After going to Beast a couple of years ago and falling madly in food love, I knew I'd give Expatriate a shot. 

First things first, the website is a real turnoff to me. It tries too hard with its microscopic, unreadable black writing, clever titles and statements like 'open eight days a week.' Barf. Portland doesn't need places to try any harder than they already do. Let's agree to not give the rest of the world reasons to make fun of us.

Moving along.

Crab Rangoon--This isn't your favorite Thai restaurant's crab rangoon. The crab is so fresh, so delicate, so tasty. The won tons were cooked perfectly and the accompanying sauce had the perfect amount of heat and sweet.

In fact, many of the dishes here incorporate amazing flavor combinations and a stunningly perfect heat.

Chinese Sausage Corn Dog--This was the only miss. My first bite was all dough and frankly, all donut. In fact, I'm guessing this is the same dough they use in the donut dessert. But as is, it missed the mark. The sausage is too sweet and gets lost in the sweet dough. The hot mustard is almost inedible, so there is nowhere to take this sweet, carby mass on a stick. Skip it.

Onion & Butter Sandwich--Everyone knows that James Beard was the mac daddy of all chefs. Actually, I have no idea who James Beard was (is?), but I know if you're a James Beard chef, you're pretty amazing. I also know this sandwich of stinky, fatty, Better Homes & Gardens Cookbook items is heavenly, I mean completely divine in my mouth. 

Brussels Sprouts & Ground Lamb--True perfection. I'm not a fan of sprouts, I merely tolerate them. This is a complex dish in which every bite makes a statement and invites you back for more. This dish embodies a team--the individual ingredients are less powerful than the way they work together. 

Korean Fried Game Hen--Plenty of meat on this bone, deliciously fried and flavored. Like the other dishes, you practically want to lick the plate because it's covered in special sauce and other tiny, sweet morsels.

The space is great--modern, romantic, hip, intimate, but maybe a bit cramped and way too dark for food that amazing. It's like she's trying to prevent the food porn culture from plastering every moment on Instagram. 

Our server was really friendly, helpful and genuinely enthusiastic. I thought it was a little much when the gentleman who delivered our food told us that the silverware was made of radon (see paragraph one).

Unsurprisingly, Naomi Pomeroy proves that in Portland, it's quality, not quantity that wins. You don't have to own 10 restaurants (or even three) to make a statement in this town. In fact, I'd like her to stay small, stay focused and stay amazing because of it.

The menu is extensive and features many of my favorite Japanese dishes.  Overall, the food is usually quite good, but occasionally the flavor, quality, and portions can be inconsistent.  

Part of the issue might be that by trying to execute on so many different types of Japanese cuisine, they can't be excellent at all of them.  There are other spots in Portland that do individual dishes (e.g., sushi, ramen) better, but none that offer a one-stop-shop of so many types of Japanese food.

They have decent sushi, but it's the other menu items that keep us coming back (it's similar to Maneki in Seattle in that way).

The yakitori-style skewer options were especially good with the tsukune (ground chicken) and pork belly (technically not yakitori since it's not chicken) becoming favorites.

It has a fun, lively, izakaya vibe, but the furnishings and extensive menu sometimes make it feel like a caricature of a Japanese restaurant.

Early and late happy hours are good times to sample across their menu (fewer choices than their regular menu but still a lot more variety than most happy hours)

I was peckish on the way home, and had been wanting to try this place for a long time. In the middle of nowhere Columbia Ave. among all the other monstrosities but not far at all from my house. I had a $20 bill (which was technically not mine but my roommate's), four $1s, and a debit card. Unbelievably, I got my dinner for exatcly $4.

A baby burger is $2. Comes on a bun with pickles, tomato? and sauce. The burger is very tiny but good - and only $2! The fries (also $2) come in a huge order! Easily enough for 2 so bring a friend when you go. The fries (with skin on) were a little greasy but simply deliscious.

I think this place is a gem and I will go back. The inside leaves a bit to be desired in the following ways: the floor was quite untidy and I really wanted the inside of this place t feel super fun or family or something.

I asked for a salt that is... well... less salty, not so sharp, so overwhelming.  And they outfitted me with Sugpo Asin and Tsushima No Moshio, two salts that perfectly fit that order and are excellent on more delicately-flavored dishes such as fish.  Expensive?  Well, more so than Morton's, that's for sure.  But this is finishing salt; you use it by the small pinch.  And it adds so much to the dish.  So, it is expensive, but well worth it.  Plan to spend a half-hour or so just chatting with the knowledgeable staff and tasting the salts; it will be time well-spent and an amazing, broadening education.

They also have an amazing selection of chocolate both for direct eating and also for cooking.  This comprehensive selection -- doubtlessly the best in Portland -- includes some world-class entries.

They were cooked to perfection and a perfect amount, not overloading the plate or skimpy, either. The eggs were a perfect over very easy and the generous portion of bacon was crispy and tasty.

However, our last several visits have shown a sharp falling off of quality in ways that even my youngest child notices, and we're at the point of looking for another sushi restaurant.  This has caused a great disturbance in the force!  Hard to imagine we'll find another place as reasonably priced and high quality as this one used to be.

Our visit last night is a good illustration of how things have gone very badly wrong with the restaurant in general:  We arrived at a time when a dozen seats at the sushi bar were open, and one table was also vacant.  However, dirty dishes and food littered all the spaces, so no seating was available.  We sat on the waiting bench for 15 minutes (!) watching the help talk to each other and move around the restaurant without attending to the customers who tried to get their attention.  Finally, one of the waitresses brought a tub and cleaned off the dishes, and another dragged a grey and filthy looking rag across the counter.  

When we sat down, my kids noticed that our shoes were on food that other guests had dropped, and a lot of it.  The bits of rice were especially sticky, so it was hard to overlook, and once we glanced down, our appetites diminished.  It appeared that food had been accumulating all day, as it was a dirty mess underneath the table.  The supplies at the table itself were all out, aside from ginger and wasabi. The soy sauce was empty, no sauce dishes, and none at any adjacent places, either.  To her credit, one waitress responded quickly to our request and brought the needed implements.  

That was the one bright spot, though:  Our orders to the sushi chefs came very slowly, and we had to ask where they were before they showed up.  The waitresses seemed to feel we were intruding on their day, at least judging by their manner, and the whole place appeared dirty and shabby--not what you want in a restaurant that serves raw fish!  When we paid, the waitress at the register didn't say a word, no smile or thank you, no word at all, and I felt bad about having left a tip.  We feel that servers should be treated generously, but our experience last night made me think these young staff members should be fired!

On the whole, this was really not a good experience, and in keeping with each of our recent visits.  I don't know if ownership has changed, or someone just stopped caring, but the place seems run by kids who don't know or care about cleanliness and customer service.

Two of us ordered the molcajete and lucky us, we had our food sitting in front of us for 10 minutes while we waited for the rest of the family's food to be brought out. The molcajetes were both missing the ""zesty avocado salsa"". The flank steak was very tough and the molcajete (yes, it's literally served in a molcajete) is about 8"" high and bowl-shaped. It was challenging to cut through the meat, what with the butter knives we had. 

Three of our party ordered fajitas, and, again they were missing the guac and also the salsa they were supposed to come with. They were also just round iron skillets with onions, peppers and the meat. I'm not sure if they're trying to make a minimalist statement by withholding beans, rice, cheese, pico de gallo, etc, but what the hay? Fajitas are kind of a diy meal. You get a bunch of stuff and you mix it up the way you like, right?

One of the fajita-orderers asked for salsa and it was crazy hot. I realize that heat is a subjective thing. Suffice it to say that my tongue can take some heat but this was habanero'ed. I could eat it but it was painful. I'm not saying I didn't eat it. I did. I can't NOT eat salsa if it's in front of my face. But I would have preferred more flavor, less heat.

In a nutshell:  The service was great. The food was palatable. The timing was horrible. And missing elements of dishes is kind of lame.

We got there at 2PM on a Friday, so we missed the happy hour (3-6PM).  She got her typical ""beer and a burger"" burger, which happens to include bacon and blue cheese pretty much regardless of the establishment serving it.  I got the Reuben, described on the menu as ""homemade corned beef piled high"" on rye bread with thousand island dressing.  We both opted for the tots as our sides, and I splurged (it was Friday) and also went with a bowl of house-made clam chowder (it is only $1 more than the cup so why not?). Oh, and we each ordered a pint of beer.  I got something red and she got something extra hoppy like an IPA.
 
The beers were outstanding, and the clam chowder was very good as well. Her burger looked very tasty and we both got a good chunk of tater tots.  The Reuben?  Well... I've had a lot of Reubens and this one was pretty... average.  And ""piled high"" really should be taken off the menu's description if what I received represents the standard there.

Updated review: just went there a second time. Not good. Don't go here on hot days!!! Their Air Conditioning is NOT sufficient to cool inside, it was miserable and they had all windows closed and manager (she) refused to open windows early evening when it was windy outside and cooler than inside!! Scratching my head in that decision. Carne Asada Fajitas were great but flour tortillas in enchiladas are like 'Rubber' very disappointing and it was the same comment from two different people other than myself! 

Well after reading some of the negatives it reminded me that bad news travels fast and good news travels slow. If you're reading this you should remember to read between the lines and differentiate if you can, who's being accurate and who is not worth listening to. 

The other reviews made me realize that there are a lot of people who live around here that have no concept of attending an adult restaurant. I always scratched my head why some parents bring children to restaurants that are clearly for adults when they SHOULD be taking their children to Denny's or some other 'family' restaurant! The last thing people want to do is to go to a very nice place and listen to annoying children being loud!!!! Or worse, a baby crying! 

The fact is this is an obvious restaurant geared for adults. Our kind of place. The first compliment I want to give is to the ambience.  It is fantastic--from the decor to the very large windows that open to the street on both sides of the building. The staff was very friendly and down to earth. Prices were inexpensive, I think they should raise their prices! This would help keep a more high end clientele. In viewing the menu I knew the food was going to be good just based on their flavorings and descriptions. 95% of all Mexican restaurants make generic Mexican food! Yes, that food is good as well but, once in awhile you will come across a rare find. The only other upscale Mexican restaurant I have found is Javier's in Newport Beach, CA. 
At Matador, the food was good. I like how you can choose a traditional dish but then they have variety of flavors and spices from which to choose for the preparation. The Queso was just ok, it's more of a bean dip with some cheese. They need to reverse it and have less bean dip and a lot more queso. With the Street Tacos they should allow you to pick what meat you want inside. Here they give you 5 tacos, each with a different meat and flavor. We found we preferred 2 of the 5. Chips and salsa were good. Salsa could be a bit more spicy. But the way they make it will allow more people to enjoy it. I would recommend having 2 salsas and let the customer get what they want. I like spicy, my wife doesn't.  The best plate I had was the Spicy Mexican Shrimp with habanero sauce and a Jalapeño Corn Bread. This plate was amazing! At the end of the day I told my wife, ""Why would we go to any other Mexican place when we can come here for the ambience?"" Most people take pics of the food. To me it's all about the atmosphere. 

We just moved to The Pearl and have not been to another Mexican restaurant in Portland prior to The Matador. No need for us to look any further!

But my biggest complaint was the little care they took to make customers comfortable. I counted three fans in the store, all pointed to the counter and prep areas, rather than out to the customers.

That being said, we were there with a group of 8 on a Saturday night. Great set-up and sweet to be accommodated. Allow me to set the mood: the night was hot. It was a scorcher. The room large with beautiful dividers made of wood and bubbly glass. Lighting was romantic. Garage doors that open into the night air... but those doors being open on night like this last Saturday was not too terribly enjoyable. In one word: SWEEEAAATTTYY. The wood chairs do not help that situation one bit.

The wine selection was pretty good - not too much in the way of entry-level choices though. There are SO many good cheap wines out there that I'd like to see at least a couple available. Okay, granted, I am going to drop a good $50 on dinner... so I guess that it just comes with the entire package - but I'd still like to have a good wine to drink while I'm waiting that doesn't cost a million dollars.

The food was great. I had the beat salad and the halibut. The beet salad was awesome because it had goat cheese on it... and quite frankly you can top a pile of crap with goat cheese and I'll probably like it. The best part about that is that the goat cheese was PILED on there. Yeah, baby... just the way I like it. The halibut was cooked to perfection. Moist and the flavors were fresh and clean. Really a great dish for keeping it light so that I could finish it off with the dark chocolate mousse. Did you say dark chocolate mousse? Oh, yes I did... and it is GOOD.

The waiter was VERY average, and that is, in my opinion, a HUGE downer in a place like this. I mean, I'm dropping some serious cash on dinner - please send me a waiter that has got his shit together. He was knowledgeable about the wine/beer/food, but didn't get me a refill on the coffee when he gave everyone else one. Also when we showed up (after everyone else already had a drink), he didn't come over to find out if we wanted a drink. Um, yo - what are you doing, dude?

They switch up the menu often, and they also do a Prix Fixe menu for $56. Seems like that'd be the way to go if your group were up for it. Overall good experience... but I needed a better waiter and some reasonably-priced wine selections.

A dozen birthday partiers recently attended Ben Bailey's late show.
Nice selection of snacks, a good beer selection, and very attentive staff were highlights of the pre-function in the north bar. Blazers game was on the television.

Reserved seating provided a good look at the stage.

Warm-up acts were entertaining.

Headliner was really funny; lots of local humor, too.
